Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized (i) a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; (ii) the lingering uncertainty about the final fiscal framework to be approved by the National Congress and, more relevant for monetary policy, its impacts on the expected paths of the public debt and of inflation expectations, and on risky assets; and (iii) a larger or more persistent deanchoring of long-term inflation expectations. Among the downside risks, it should be noted (i) an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency; (ii) a greater than projected deceleration of global economic activity, particularly due to adverse conditions in the global financial system; and (iii) a slowdown in domestic credit concession larger than what would be compatible with the current stance of monetary policy. </p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">On the one hand, the reinstatement of fuel taxes and, primarily, the presentation of a proposal for the fiscal framework have partly reduced the uncertainty arising from fiscal policy. On the other hand, the current scenario, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower in an environment of deanchored inflation expectations, requires further attention when conducting monetary policy. Copom emphasizes that there is no mechanical relationship between the convergence of inflation and the fiscal framework, and judges that the deanchoring of long-term inflation expectations raises the cost of the disinflation that is needed to reach the targets established by the National Monetary Council.

Among the downside risks, it should be noted (i) a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in the price of international <em>commodities </em>measured in local currency; and (ii) a greater deceleration of economic activity than projected. The Committee assesses that the possibility that fiscal policies that support aggregate demand become permanent heightens the upside risks of the inflationary scenario.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by
one percentage point, to 11.25 percent per year, without bias.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario&#58;</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The set of indicators of economic activity released since the last Copom meeting remains consistent with stabilization of the economy in the short run. Available evidence suggests a gradual recovery of economic activity during the course of 2017;</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The global outlook remains quite uncertain. Nevertheless, developments have so far mitigated the effects on the Brazilian economy of possible changes in economic policy in some large economies, notably in the United States. There is uncertainty regarding the sustainability of global economic growth and the stability of current commodity price levels;</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">Inflation developments remain favorable. The disinflation process is more widespread, and disinflation of IPCA components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy has consolidated. Food price disinflation constitutes a favorable supply shock;</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">Inflation expectations for 2017 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.1%. Expectations for 2018 remain around 4.5%, and expectations for 2019 and longer horizons are slightly below that level; and</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The Copom's inflation forecasts for 2017 and 2018 in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey are around 4.1% and 4.5%, respectively. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2017 at 8.5% and remains at that level until the end of 2018.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The Committee emphasizes that its baseline scenario involves risks in both directions&#58; (i) the highly uncertain global outlook might make disinflation more difficult; (ii) the approval and implementation of reforms – notably those of fiscal nature – and of adjustments in the Brazilian economy are important for the sustainability of disinflation and for the reduction of its structural interest rate; (iii) the favorable food-price shock might produce second-round effects and, thus, contribute to additional reductions of inflation expectations and inflation in other economic sectors; and (iv) the recovery of economic activity might be more (or less) gradual and delayed than currently anticipated.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and a wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to 11.25 percent per year, without bias. This moderate intensification of the pace of monetary easing, relative to the pace set in the January and February Copom meetings, is, at this time, appropriate.

However, in face of the environment with anchored inflation expectations, the Committee judges that the current scenario with more widespread disinflation and weaker-than-expected economic activity makes it already appropriate to frontload the monetary easing cycle, and allows the new pace of easing.

However, uncertainties regarding global economic growth and, especially, the pace of monetary policy normalization in the United States, remain;<p>  Recent inflation releases were more favorable than expected, partly due to a reversal of increases in food prices.<p>  Inflation expectations for 2017 collected by the Focus survey fell to around 5.0% since the previous Copom meeting and the last Inflation Report, and remain above the 4.5% inflation target. Expectations for 2018 and longer horizons are already around that level; and<p>  The Committee’s inflation forecasts for 2016 in the reference and market scenarios fell since the last Inflation Report, to around 7.0%. Over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, the behavior of inflation forecasts have differed according to the scenario. Under the assumptions of the reference scenario, the forecast for 2017 inflation fell to approximately 4.3%, whereas the forecast for 2018 sits around 3.9%.

"<div> <p>Brasília - The Copom decided to reduce the Selic rate to 12.00 percent, without bias, with five votes for the monetary policy action and two votes in favor of maintaining the Selic rate at 12.50 percent. Reassessing the international scenario, the Copom considers that there was substantial deterioration, materialized, for instance, in generalized and significant reduction in growth projections for the main economic blocks. The Committee understands that there was an increase in the chances that restrictions to which today several mature economies are exposed prolong for a period greater than previously anticipated. It also notices that, in these economies, the scope for the use of monetary policy seems limited, and a scenario of fiscal restriction prevails. Therefore, the Committee evaluates that the international scenario shows disinflationary bias in the relevant forecast period. </p><p>For the Copom, the transmission of external developments for the Brazilian economy may materialize through several channels, among others, the reduction in the current of trade, moderation of the investments flow, more restrictive credit conditions and deterioration in the consumers and businessmen sentiment. The Committee understands that the complexity that surrounds the international scenario will contribute to intensify and accelerate the ongoing process of domestic activity moderation, which already materializes, for example, in the retreat of projections for the Brazilian economy growth. Therefore, in the relevant forecast period, the balance of risks for inflation becomes more favorable. By the way, the revision of the scenario for the fiscal policy also points in the same direction.</p><p>Under this context, the Copom understands that, by promptly mitigating the effects stemming from a more restrictive global environment, a moderate adjustment in the basic rate level is consistent with the scenario of convergence of inflation to the target in 2012.</p><p>The Committee will carefully monitor the evolution of macroeconomic environment and the developments in the international scenario, so that it then defines the next steps in its monetary policy strategy.</p><p>The August Copom Minutes will be released in Portuguese next Thursday, September 8.</p> </div>",2011-08-31T03:00:00Z,,2160,161st Meeting,False,False
