"<p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">In its 252<sup>nd</sup> meeting, Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The following observations provide an update of Copom's scenario&#58;<br></p><ul><li>The global environment continues to be adverse and volatile, marked by prospects of below-potential global growth for next year, high volatility of financial assets and an inflationary environment under pressure, despite more positive signs at the margin. The process of monetary policy tightening in advanced economies and the stronger market sensitivity to fiscal fundamentals require more caution by developing economies. However, recent global activity data has shown some resilience, and the relaxation of sanitary restrictions in the Chinese economy attenuates the possibility of new global supply chain disruptions;</li><li>Regarding the Brazilian economy, the recent set of indicators continues to be in line with the scenario of deceleration expected by Copom;</li><li>Notwithstanding some recent moderation, consumer inflation as well as the various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target;</li><li>Inflation expectations for 2023 and 2024 collected by the Focus survey are around 5.7% and 3.9%, respectively;</li><li>Copom's inflation projections in the reference scenario* stand at 5.6% for 2023 and 3.4% for 2024. Inflation projections for administered prices are 10.6% for 2023 and 5.0% for 2024. The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon, which refers to the third quarter of 2024, in which the 12-month inflation projection stands at 3.6%; </li><li>In an alternative scenario, with a constant interest rate throughout the relevant horizon, inflation projections stand at 5.5%, 3.1% and 2.8% for 2023, the third quarter of 2024 and 2024, respectively; and</li><li>The Committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual.</li></ul><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized (i) a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; (ii) the still heightened uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and fiscal stimuli that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices; and (iii) an output gap tighter than the one currently adopted by the Committee in its reference scenario, especially in the labor market. Among the downside risks, it should be noted (i) an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency; (ii) a greater than projected deceleration of global economic activity; and (iii) the continuity of tax cuts assumed to be reversed in 2023. </p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The current scenario, particularly uncertain on the fiscal side and with inflation expectations drifting away from the inflation target on longer horizons, requires further attention in the conduct of monetary policy. The Committee judges that this scenario raises the cost of the disinflation that is needed to reach the targets established by the National Monetary Council. In this scenario, Copom reaffirms its commitment to set monetary policy to meet the targets.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">Considering the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a larger degree, 2024. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full employment.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The Committee remains vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a longer period than in the reference scenario will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets, which have shown deterioration at longer horizons since the previous meeting. The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The following members of the Committee voted for this decision&#58; Roberto de Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor), Bruno Serra Fernandes, Carolina de Assis Barros, Diogo Abry Guillen, Fernanda Magalhães Rumenos Guardado, Maurício Costa de Moura, Otávio Ribeiro Damaso, Paulo Sérgio Neves de Souza and Renato Dias de Brito Gomes. </p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">&#160;<br></p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">* In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey, and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.15 and evolves according to the purchasing power parity (PPP). The Committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing 2% per year onwards. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be &quot;yellow&quot; in December 2023 and 2024. The value for the exchange rate is obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">&#160;</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">Note&#58; This press release represents the Copom's best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.

This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that rises to 12% in the first half of 2022, ends the year at 11.75%, and drops to 8.00% during 2023. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 6.6% for 2022 and 5.4% for 2023. The energy flag is assumed to be &quot;red level 1&quot; in December of 2022 and 2023.</li></ul><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The Committee emphasizes that risks to its reference scenario remain in both directions.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">On the one hand, a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in the price of international <em>commodities </em>measured in local currency would produce a lower-than-projected inflation in the reference scenario.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">On the other hand, fiscal policies that imply additional impulses to aggregate demand or deteriorate the future fiscal path may have a negative impact on prices of important financial assets as well as pressure the country's risk premium. </p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">In spite of the more favorable public accounts data, the Committee assesses that the uncertainties regarding the fiscal framework maintain elevated the risk of deanchoring inflation expectations and, therefore, the upward asymmetry in the balance of risks. This implies a higher probability of inflation paths above the one projected under the reference scenario.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">Taking into account the reference scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 1.50 p.p. to 10.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its reference scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022 and, to a larger degree, 2023. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The Committee considers that, given the increase in its inflation projections and in the risk of a deanchoring of long-term expectations, it is appropriate to advance the process of monetary tightening significantly into the restrictive territory. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets consolidate.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">For its next steps, the Committee foresees as adequate, at this moment, a reduction in the pace of adjustment of the interest rate. This indication reflects the stage of the tightening cycle as its cumulative effects will manifest themselves over the relevant horizon. The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">The following members of the Committee voted for this decision&#58; Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor), Bruno Serra Fernandes, Carolina de Assis Barros, Fernanda Magalhães Rumenos Guardado, João Manoel Pinho de Mello, Maurício Costa de Moura, Otávio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Sérgio Neves de Souza.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">&#160;</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">*Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting.</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">Note&#58; This press release represents the Copom's best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.

However, new fiscal stimulus in some developed countries and the rollout of COVID-19 immunization programs should promote a solid economic recovery in the medium term. Economic slack and central bank communication from major economies suggest monetary stimuli will last long, resulting in a favorable environment for emerging economies;</p><p style=""text-align&#58;justify;"">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Turning to the Brazilian economy, indicators regarding growth at the end of last year have been better than expected, but they do not capture the effects of the recent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.

"<div> <p>The Copom released the following note to the public&#58;<p>&quot;204th Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (“Copom”) of the Central Bank of Brazil Press Release*<p>  The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate to 13.00 percent per year, without bias.<p>The following observations provide an update of the Copom’s baseline scenario&#58;<p>  The set of indicators released since the last Copom meeting suggests weaker-than-expected economic activity. Available evidence indicates that the economic recovery should be delayed even further, and be more gradual than previously anticipated;<p>  The global outlook remains quite uncertain. Nevertheless, the end of the benign environment for emerging economies has had a limited impact so far;<p>  Recent inflation releases were more favorable than expected. There are signs that the more widespread disinflation process has reached IPCA components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy;<p>  IPCA inflation for 2016 ended at 6.3%, well below expectations held a few months ago, and within the tolerance limits set for the inflation target for last year;<p>  Inflation expectations for 2017 collected by the Focus survey fell to around 4.8%. Expectations collected by the same survey for 2018 and longer horizons remained anchored, around 4.5%;<p>  The Committee’s conditional inflation forecasts retreated relative to those in the latest Inflation Report, which were based on information available until December 9, 2016. Among other factors, changes in forecasts were influenced by inflation and economic activity data released since then. In the reference scenario, forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are around 4.0% and 3.4%, respectively. The market scenario for 2017 and 2018 shows inflation around 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively; and<p>  The process of consideration and approval of fiscal reforms by the Congress has been positive so far.<p>   The Committee identifies the following risks to the baseline scenario for inflation&#58;<p>  On the one hand, (i) the highly uncertain global outlook might make disinflation more difficult; (ii) the process of disinflation of some IPCA components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy requires continuous attention; (iii) the process of approval and implementation of the necessary reforms and adjustments in the economy is lengthy, and carries uncertainty.<p>  On the other hand, (iv) weaker economic activity and a high level of economic slack may produce disinflation at a faster pace than the one embedded in the Copom’s conditional forecasts; (v) short-run inflation behavior has been more favorable, which may signal lower inflation persistence; and (vi) the process of approval and implementation of the necessary reforms and adjustments in the economy may be faster than anticipated.<p>  Taking into account the baseline scenario, the current balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate to 13.00 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2017 and, with a gradually increasing weight, 2018, is compatible with an intensification of the ongoing monetary easing process.<p>  The Copom entertained reducing the Selic rate to 13.25 percent per year and signaling a larger cut at the next meeting. However, in face of the environment with anchored inflation expectations, the Committee judges that the current scenario with more widespread disinflation and weaker-than-expected economic activity makes it already appropriate to frontload the monetary easing cycle, and allows the new pace of easing. The extension of the cycle and possible revisions of the pace of easing will continue to depend on inflation forecasts and expectations, and on the evolution of the aforementioned risk factors.<p>  The following members of the Committee voted for this decision&#58; Ilan Goldfajn (Governor), Anthero de Moraes Meirelles, Carlos Viana de Carvalho, Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira, Luiz Edson Feltrim, Otávio Ribeiro Damaso, Reinaldo Le Grazie, Sidnei Corrêa Marques and Tiago Couto Berriel.&quot;<p>  * This press release represents the Copom’s best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.
