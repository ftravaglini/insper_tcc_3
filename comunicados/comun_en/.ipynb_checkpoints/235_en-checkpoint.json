[{"Titulo": "Copom maintains Selic rate at 2.00% p.a.", "Conteudo": "In its 235th\u00a0meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a.The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the global outlook, the pandemic resurgence in some major economies is reversing previous mobility gains and should affect short-term activity. However, promising results in COVID-19 vaccine trials tend to improve confidence and growth in the medium term. Economic slack and central bank communication from major economies suggest monetary stimuli will last long, resulting in a favorable environment for emerging economies;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to the Brazilian economy, recent indicators suggest the uneven recovery in economic activity continues, as expected. However, prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than usual, especially for the period starting at the end of this year, concurrently with the expected unwinding of the emergency transfer programs;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The latest inflation readings were higher than expected and, despite the predicted retraction of food price pressures, December inflation should still remain elevated. In spite of the stronger short-term inflationary pressure, the Committee maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are temporary, but continues to monitor closely its evolution, in particular the core inflation readings;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The various measures of underlying inflation are in levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.2%, 3.3%, and 3.5%, respectively;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at R$5.25/US$* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 4.3% for 2020, 3.4% for 2021 and 3.4% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.00% p.a., rises to 3.00% p.a. in 2021 and 4.50% p.a. in 2022; and\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scenario with constant interest rate at 2.00% p.a. and exchange rate starting at\u00a0R$5.25/US$* and evolving according to the PPP yields inflation projections around 4.3% for 2020, 3.5% for 2021 and 4.0% for 2022.The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions.On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory, especially when the slack is concentrated in the service sector. This risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary savings.On the other hand, an extension of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravate the fiscal path or a\u00a0frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. The relative increase in the risks of these events imply an upward asymmetry to the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy.The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate.Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021 and 2022.The Committee deems as adequate the current level of unusually strong monetary stimulus, which is being provided by the maintenance of the policy rate at 2.00% p.a. and the forward guidance introduced in the 232nd meeting. The forward guidance stated that the Copom does not intend to reduce the monetary stimulus as long as specified conditions are met. The Committee judges that those conditions continue to hold. In spite of having increased since the last meeting, in particular for 2021, inflation expectations, as well as inflation projections for its baseline scenario, are still below the inflation target for the relevant horizon for monetary policy; the current fiscal regime has not been changed; and long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.The Copom judges that, since adoption of the forward guidance, inflation expectations reversed their declining trend relative to the target for the relevant horizon. Additionally, over the next months, the 2021 calendar-year should become less relevant than the 2022 calendar-year, for which projections and expected inflation are around the target. A scenario of inflation expectations converging to the target suggests that the conditions for maintaining the forward guidance may soon no longer apply, which does not mechanically imply interest rates increases, since economic conditions still prescribe an extraordinarily strong monetary stimulus. In case the forward guidance ceases to apply, monetary policy will follow the inflation target framework, based on the analysis of prospective inflation and its balance of risks.\u00a0 The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor), Bruno Serra Fernandes, Carolina de Assis Barros, Fabio Kanczuk, Fernanda Feitosa Nechio, Jo\u00e3o Manoel Pinho de Mello, Maur\u00edcio Costa de Moura, Ot\u00e1vio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Neves de Souza.\u00a0*Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting.Note: This press release represents the Copom's best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.
