[{"Titulo": "Copom increases the Selic rate to 2.75% p.a.", "Conteudo": "\u200bIn its 237th\u00a0meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 2.75% p.a.The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the global outlook, new fiscal stimuli in some developed countries and the advancement of the COVID-19 immunization programs should promote a more robust economic recovery throughout the year. Economic slack and central bank communication from major economies suggest monetary stimuli will last long. However, market discussion regarding inflationary risks in these economies, and the associated repricing of financial assets, could result in a more challenging environment for emerging economies;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to the Brazilian economy, recent indicators, particularly the GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, continued to suggest a consistent economic recovery in spite of the reduction in the emergency income transfers. However, these readings do not capture the effects of the recent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than usual, especially for the first and second quarters of this year;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The continuing increase in commodities prices, measured in local currency, is\u00a0affecting current inflation and has\u00a0triggered additional increases in inflation forecasts for the next months, especially through its effects on fuel prices. In spite of these stronger and more persistent than expected short-term inflationary pressures, the Committee maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are temporary, but continues to closely monitor its evolution;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The various measures of underlying inflation are in levels above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inflation expectations for 2021, 2022, and 2023 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.6%, 3.5%, and 3.25%, respectively; and\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at R$5.70/US$* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 5.0% for 2021 and 3.5% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2021 at 4.50% p.a. and rises to 5.50% p.a. in 2022. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 9.5% for 2021 and 4.4% for 2022.The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions.On the one hand, the worsening of the pandemic may delay the economic recovery, producing a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory.On the other hand, an extension of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravates the fiscal path or a\u00a0frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. The relative increase in the risks of these events imply an upward asymmetry to the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy.The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate.Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 0.75 p.p. to 2.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021 and, mainly, 2022.The Copom members consider that the current conditions ceased to prescribe an extraordinary stimulus. GDP ended 2020 growing strongly at the margin, recovering most of its first-semester decline, and inflation expectations rose above target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Additionally, inflation projections increased to levels close to the upper bound of the target for 2021.Therefore, the Copom decided to start a process of partial normalization by reducing the extraordinary degree of monetary stimulus. For all the aforementioned reasons, the Committee considered appropriate an adjustment of 0.75 p.p. in the Selic rate. In the Committee's evaluation, a swifter adjustment has the benefit of reducing the probability of not meeting the inflation target in 2021, as well as of keeping longer horizon expectations well anchored. Additionally, the broad set of information available to the Committee suggests that this strategy is consistent with meeting the 2022 inflation target, even if social distancing increases temporarily.For the next meeting, unless there is a significant change in inflation projections or in the balance of risks, the Committee foresees the continuation of the partial normalization process with another adjustment, of the same magnitude, in the degree of monetary stimulus. The Copom emphasizes that its view for the next meeting will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations.The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor), Bruno Serra Fernandes, Carolina de Assis Barros, Fabio Kanczuk, Fernanda Feitosa Nechio, Jo\u00e3o Manoel Pinho de Mello, Maur\u00edcio Costa de Moura, Ot\u00e1vio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Neves de Souza.\u00a0*Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting.Note: This press release represents the Copom's best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.
