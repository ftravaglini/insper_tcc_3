[{"Titulo": "Copom maintains Selic rate at 2.00% p.a.", "Conteudo": "\u200bIn its 234th\u00a0meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a.The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the global outlook, the strong recovery in some economic sectors seems to be subsiding, partly due to the pandemic resurgence in some major economies. There is significant uncertainty regarding the evolution of this scenario due to a possible decline in government stimuli and to the evolution of the COVID-19 itself. However, the moderation in financial assets volatility keeps resulting in a relatively favorable environment for emerging economies;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to the Brazilian economy, similarly to other countries, recent indicators suggest an uneven recovery in economic activity. Sectors more directly affected by social distancing measures remain depressed despite the offsetting effects of the transfer programs. Prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than usual, especially for the period starting at the end of this year, concurrently with the expected unwinding of the emergency transfer programs;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The latest inflation readings were higher than expected and the Committee raised its projection for the remaining months of 2020. This revision was due to continuing food and industrial price increases which, in turn, are a consequence of a persistent exchange rate depreciation, the oil price rise, and the income transfer programs. In spite of the stronger short-term inflationary pressure, the Committee maintains the diagnosis that this shock is temporary, but closely monitors its evolution;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The various measures of underlying inflation are in levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.0%, 3.1%, and 3.5%, respectively;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at R$5.60/US$* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 3.1% for 2020, 3.1% for 2021 and 3.3% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.00% p.a., rises to 2.75% p.a. in 2021 and 4.50% p.a. in 2022; and\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scenario with constant interest rate at 2.00% p.a. and exchange rate starting at\u00a0R$5.60/US$* and evolving according to the PPP yields inflation projections around 3.1% for 2020, 3.2% for 2021 and 3.8% for 2022.The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions.On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory, especially when the slack is concentrated in the service sector. This risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary savings.On the other hand, the extension of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravate the fiscal path or a\u00a0frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. The relative increase in the risks of these events imply an upward asymmetry to the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy.The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate.Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021 and 2022.The Copom believes that the current economic conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus but it recognizes that, due to prudential and financial stability reasons, the remaining space for monetary policy stimulus, if it exists, should be small. The Committee deems as adequate the current level of monetary stimulus, which is being provided by the maintenance of the policy rate at 2.00% p.a. and the forward guidance introduced in the 232nd meeting. The forward guidance stated that the Copom does not intend to reduce the monetary stimulus as long as specified conditions are met. The Committee judges that those conditions continue to hold: inflation expectations, as well as inflation projections for its baseline scenario, are significantly below the inflation target for the relevant horizon for monetary policy; the current fiscal regime has not been changed; and long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor), Bruno Serra Fernandes, Carolina de Assis Barros, Fabio Kanczuk, Fernanda Feitosa Nechio, Jo\u00e3o Manoel Pinho de Mello, Maur\u00edcio Costa de Moura, Ot\u00e1vio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Neves de Souza.\u00a0*Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting.Note: This press release represents the Copom's best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.
