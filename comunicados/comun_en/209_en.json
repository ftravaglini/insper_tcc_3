[{"Titulo": "209th Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (\u201cCopom\u201d) of the Central Bank of Brazil Press Release*", "Conteudo": "The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to 8.25 percent per year, without bias.The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:The set of indicators of economic activity released since the last Copom meeting is consistent with a gradual recovery of the Brazilian economy;The global outlook has been favorable, as global economic activity remains on a gradual recovery path, without pressuring financial conditions in advanced economies. This supports risk appetite towards emerging economies;Inflation developments remain favorable, with various measures of underlying inflation running at low levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy;Inflation expectations collected by the Focus survey edged up to around 3.4% for 2017 and remained around 4.2% for 2018. Expectations for 2019 are around 4.25%, and expectations for 2020 are around 4.00%; andThe Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey retreated to around 3.3% for 2017, and increased to around 4.4% for 2018. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2017 at 7.25%, edges down to 7.00% in early 2018 and reaches 7.5% by the end of the year.The Committee emphasizes that its baseline scenario involves risks in both directions. On the one hand, the combination of (i) possible second-round effects of the ongoing favorable food price shock and of low current levels of industrial goods inflation, and (ii) the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of the low level of current inflation, including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy, may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, (iii) frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case of a (iv) reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging economies.Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to 8.25 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018, is compatible with the monetary easing process.The Committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level.The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms, such as the recently approved credit policy measures, and adjustments in the Brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over time.The Copom emphasizes that economic conditions have allowed the same pace of monetary easing at this meeting. Regarding the next Copom meeting, provided the Committee\u2019s baseline scenario evolve as expected, and taking into account the stage of the monetary easing cycle, at this time the Copom views a moderate reduction of the pace of easing as appropriate. In addition, under those same circumstances, the Copom foresees a gradual ending to the cycle. Notwithstanding these perspectives, the Copom emphasizes that the monetary easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle, and on inflation forecasts and expectations.The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor), Anthero de Moraes Meirelles, Carlos Viana de Carvalho, Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira, Luiz Edson Feltrim, Ot\u00e1vio Ribeiro Damaso, Reinaldo Le Grazie, Sidnei Corr\u00eaa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel.* This press release represents the Copom\u2019s best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.
