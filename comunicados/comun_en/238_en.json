[{"Titulo": "Copom increases the Selic rate to 3.50% p.a.", "Conteudo": "In its 238th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 3.50% p.a.The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the global outlook, new fiscal stimuli in some developed countries and the advancement of the COVID-19 immunization programs should promote a more robust economic recovery throughout the year. Economic slack and central bank communication from major economies suggest monetary stimuli will last long. However, market discussion regarding inflationary risks in these economies could result in a more challenging environment for emerging economies;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to the Brazilian economy, recent indicators are evolving better than expected in spite of the second wave of the pandemic being more intense than anticipated. Prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth still remains larger than usual, but should gradually return to its normal level;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the exception of oil, commodity prices continued to increase, impacting food and industrial price forecasts. Additionally, the transition to higher energy prices should keep inflation under pressure in the short run. The Committee maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are temporary, but continues to closely monitor its evolution;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The various measures of underlying inflation are at the top of the range compatible with meeting the inflation target; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inflation expectations for 2021, 2022, and 2023 collected by the Focus survey are around 5.0%, 3.6%, and 3.25%, respectively; and\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at R$5.40/US$* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 5.1% for 2021 and 3.4% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2021 at 5.50% p.a. and rises to 6.25% p.a. in 2022. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 8.4% for 2021 and 5.0% for 2022.The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions.On the one hand, economic recovery from the pandemic can be slower than estimated, producing a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory.On the other hand, further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravate the fiscal path, or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda, may add pressure to the country's risk premium. The elevated fiscal risk creates an upward asymmetry in the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy.The Committee reiterates that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate.Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 0.75 p.p. to 3.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022. Without compromising its fundamental objective of price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment.At this moment, the Copom's baseline scenario indicates that a partial normalization of the policy rate remains appropriate to keep some degree of monetary stimulus during the economic recovery. However, the Committee emphasizes that there is no commitment with this plan, and that future steps of monetary policy could be adjusted to assure the achievement of the inflation target.For the next meeting the Committee foresees the continuation of the partial normalization process with another adjustment of the same magnitude in the degree of monetary stimulus. The Copom emphasizes that its view will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations.The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor), Bruno Serra Fernandes, Carolina de Assis Barros, Fabio Kanczuk, Fernanda Feitosa Nechio, Jo\u00e3o Manoel Pinho de Mello, Maur\u00edcio Costa de Moura, Ot\u00e1vio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Neves de Souza.\u00a0*Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting.Note: This press release represents the Copom's best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.
