[{"Titulo": "Copom lowers Selic rate to 2.25% p.a.", "Conteudo": "In its 231st\u00a0meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 2.25% p.a.The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the global outlook, the COVID-19 pandemic keeps causing a pronounced slowdown in global growth. Against this backdrop, despite the significant provision of fiscal and monetary stimuli in major economies and some moderation in financial assets volatility, the environment for emerging economies remains challenging;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to economic activity, the first-quarter data release showed the largest GDP decline since 2015, reflecting the initial effects of the pandemic. Recent indicators suggest the second-quarter economic activity contraction will be even larger. Prospectively, uncertainty about the second-semester economic recovery remains larger than usual;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running below the level compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 1.6%, 3.0%, and 3.5%, respectively;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Copom's inflation projections in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$4.95/US$* stand around 2.0% for 2020 and 3.2% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.25% p.a. and rises to 3.00% p.a. in 2021; and\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scenario with constant interest rate at 3.00% p.a. and constant exchange rate at\u00a0R$4.95/US$* yields inflation projections around 1.9% for 2020 and 3.0% for 2021.The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions.On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. This risk increases if a lengthening of the pandemic causes an increase in uncertainty and precautionary savings and, consequently, implies a decline in aggregate demand that is larger and longer than estimated.On the other hand, fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal path or a\u00a0frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. Additionally, the credit and transfer programs implemented in response to the pandemic may cause a smaller-than-estimated decline in aggregate demand, introducing an asymmetry to the balance of risks. This set of factors could potentially result in a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy.The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate.Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 2.25% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021.The Copom believes that the current state of affairs continues to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus, but it recognizes that the remaining space for monetary policy stimulus is uncertain and should be small. The Committee believes that the fiscal trajectory over the next year, as well as the perception of its sustainability, are crucial to determine the length of the stimulus.At the present moment, the Committee judges that the magnitude of the monetary stimulus already implemented seems compatible with the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the next meetings, the Committee sees as appropriate to evaluate the impact of the pandemic and of the set of credit and transfer programs in place, and foresees that any possible adjustment to the current monetary stimulus would be residual. However, the Copom remains attentive to revisions of the economic scenario and of the inflation expectations for the relevant horizon of monetary policy. The Committee recognizes that the variance of its balance of risks has increased and that further information on the evolution of the pandemic, as well as a decline in fiscal uncertainty, will be essential to determine its next steps.The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor), Bruno Serra Fernandes, Carolina de Assis Barros, Fernanda Feitosa Nechio, Jo\u00e3o Manoel Pinho de Mello, Maur\u00edcio Costa de Moura, Ot\u00e1vio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Neves de Souza.\u00a0*Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting.Note: This press release represents the Copom's best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.
