[{"Titulo": "Copom lowers Selic rate to 3.00% p.a.", "Conteudo": "In its 230th\u00a0meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 3.00% p.a.The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the global outlook, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing a significant slowdown in global growth, a drop of commodity prices, and an increase in asset prices volatility. Against this backdrop, despite the additional provision of fiscal and monetary stimuli in major economies, and some moderation in financial assets volatility, the environment for emerging economies remains challenging, with capital outflows significantly larger than in previous episodes;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to economic activity, data through March reflect only partly the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic over the Brazilian economy. Higher frequency and more timely indicators for April show that the economic contraction will be significantly deeper than forecasted in the previous meeting;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running below the level compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy; \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 2.0%, 3.3%, and 3.5%, respectively;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Copom's inflation projections in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$5.55/US$* stand around 2.4% for 2020 and 3.4% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.75% p.a. and rises to 3.75% p.a. in 2021. It also assumes that Brent oil prices rise about 40% by the end of 2020; and\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scenario with constant interest rate at 3.75% p.a., constant exchange rate at\u00a0R$5.55/US$*, and the same assumptions regarding oil prices yields inflation projections around 2.3% for 2020 and 3.2% for 2021.The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions.On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. This risk increases if a worsening of the pandemic implies an increase in uncertainty and precautionary savings and, consequently, implies a decline in aggregate demand that is larger or\u00a0longer than anticipated.On the other hand, fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal trajectory or a\u00a0frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium and imply a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy.The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that doubts regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate.Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 3.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021.The Copom believes that the current state of affairs recommends an unusually large monetary stimulus, but it reinforces that there are potential limits to the remaining space for adjustment. The Committee believes that the fiscal trajectory over the next year, as well as the perception of its sustainability, will be crucial to determine the length of the stimulus.Two Committee members pondered that, even with the possibility of an increase in the structural rate, it could be appropriate to provide the overall monetary stimulus immediately, in combination with a guidance of keeping the interest rate constant for the next months, in order to reduce the probability of missing the inflation target for 2021. However, the prevalent view was that, in light of the elevated uncertainty domestically, the remaining scope for monetary policy is unknown and may be small. Therefore, the Copom chose to provide a more moderate stimulus, for the benefit of gathering more information until its next meeting.For the next meeting, conditional on the fiscal scenario and on the economic data, the Committee considers a final monetary adjustment, not larger than this one, to complete the change to the policy rate that it deems adequate to counteract the economic consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Committee recognizes that the variance of its balance of risks has increased and that further information on the effects of the pandemic in the economy, as well as a decline in fiscal uncertainty, will be essential to determine its next steps.The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor), Bruno Serra Fernandes, Carolina de Assis Barros, F\u00e1bio Kanczuk, Fernanda Feitosa Nechio, Maur\u00edcio Costa de Moura, Ot\u00e1vio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Neves de Souza.\u00a0*Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting.Note: This press release represents the Copom's best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.
