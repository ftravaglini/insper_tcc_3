[{"Titulo": "Copom lowers Selic rate to 4.50% p.a.", "Conteudo": "In its 227th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 4.50% p.a.The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:Data on economic activity since the second quarter indicate that the process of economic recovery picked up relative to the first quarter of 2019. Copom's baseline scenario assumes that this recovery will occur at a gradual pace;Regarding the global outlook, the provision of monetary stimulus in major economies, in a context of economic slowdown and below-target inflation, has been able to generate a relatively favorable environment for emerging economies;The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at comfortable levels, including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy;Inflation expectations for 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.8%, 3.6%, 3.75%, and 3.5%, respectively;The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 4.0% for 2019, 3.5% for 2020, and 3.4% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2019 at 4.50% p.a., falls to 4.25% p.a. at the beginning of 2020, ends that year at 4.50% p.a., and rises to 6.25% p.a. in 2021. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2019 at R$4.15/US$, 2020 at R$4.10/US$ and 2021 at R$4.00/US$; andThe hybrid scenario with a constant exchange rate at R$4.20/US$*, and the interest rate path from the Focus survey yields inflation projections around 4.0% for 2019, 3.7% for 2020, and 3.7% for 2021.The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, (i) the high level of economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, (ii) in the context of changes in financial intermediation, the current degree of monetary stimulus, which affects the economy with lags, increases the uncertainty about the transmission channels and may raise the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. Risk (ii) intensifies in case of (iii) a deterioration of the outlook for emerging economies or (iv) a possible frustration regarding the continuation of reforms and the perseverance in the necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy.Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 4.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2020 and, to a lesser extent, 2021.The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level.The Copom sees progress in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy. The Committee emphasizes that persevering in this process is essential to allow for the consolidation of the reduction of the structural interest rate and for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom stresses that the perception of the continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections.The Copom judges that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy. The Committee emphasizes that its next steps will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations.The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor), Bruno Serra Fernandes, Carolina de Assis Barros, F\u00e1bio Kanczuk, Fernanda Feitosa Nechio, Jo\u00e3o Manoel Pinho de Mello, Maur\u00edcio Costa de Moura, Ot\u00e1vio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Neves de Souza.\u00a0*Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting.Note: This press release represents the Copom's best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.
