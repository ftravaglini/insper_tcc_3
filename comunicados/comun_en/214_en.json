[{"Titulo": "214th Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (\u201cCopom\u201d) of the Central Bank of Brazil Press Release", "Conteudo": "The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a.The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:The latest indicators show softening of economic activity in the context of a consistent, albeit gradual, recovery of the Brazilian economy;The global outlook has become more challenging and showed volatility. The evolution of risks associated, to a large extent, with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies led to adjustments in international financial markets. As a result, risk appetite towards emerging economies has diminished;The Committee judges that inflation developments remain favorable, with various measures of underlying inflation running still at low levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy;Inflation expectations for 2018 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.5%. Expectations for 2019 and 2020 are around 4.0%; andThe Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.6% for 2018, and 3.9% for 2019. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2018 at 6.5% p.a., and 2019 at 8.0% p.a., and a path for the exchange rate that ends both 2018 and 2019 at R$/US$ 3.40. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.50% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 3.60*, the projections for both 2018 and 2019 stand around 4.0%.The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, (i) possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation levels may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, (ii) frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case of (iii) further changes in the global outlook for emerging economies. The latter risk has intensified since the last Copom meeting.The Copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and expectations, of the balance of risks, and of economic activity. External shocks should only lead to responses to second-round effects they might produce on prospective inflation (that is, in the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the shock). These shocks, however, may change the balance of risks by reducing the chances that inflation will remain below target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, through its possible second-round effects.Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the recent change in the balance of risks to prospective inflation and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and, to a greater extent, 2019.The Committee reiterates that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level.The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over time.In the Copom\u2019s assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and, mainly, of the balance of risks made it unnecessary to ease monetary policy further in order to mitigate the risk of delayed convergence of inflation toward the targets. Regarding the next meetings, the Committee deems appropriate to maintain its policy rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations.The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor), Carlos Viana de Carvalho, Carolina de Assis Barros, Maur\u00edcio Costa de Moura, Ot\u00e1vio Ribeiro Damaso, Paulo S\u00e9rgio Neves de Souza, Reinaldo Le Grazie, Sidnei Corr\u00eaa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel.* Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting.Note: This press release represents the Copom\u2019s best effort to provide an English version of its policy statement.
