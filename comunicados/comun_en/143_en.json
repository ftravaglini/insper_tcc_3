[{"Titulo": "143rd Meeting", "Conteudo": " Bras\u00edlia - In light of inflation prospects for the targets path, the Copom decided to lower the Selic rate to 9.25 percent, without bias, with six votes for the monetary policy action and two votes in favor of reducing the Selic rate by 0.75 p.p. Considering that changes in the basic interest rates have effects over economic activity and inflationary dynamics which accumulate throughout time, the Committee agrees that any additional monetary easing should be implemented in a more parsimonious way. The Copom will closely monitor the evolution of the prospective scenario for inflation until its next meeting in order to define the next steps of the monetary policy strategy.
