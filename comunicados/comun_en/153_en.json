[{"Titulo": "153rd Meeting", "Conteudo": " Bras\u00edlia - The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic target at 10.75 percent, without bias. While the Copom does not expect the inflation level registered in the last months to continue in a near future, it observes the continuation of the process of risk reduction for the inflationary scenario that has materialized since the penultimate meeting. In this context, the Committee evaluates that, at the moment, the maintenance of the basic interest rate at the level established in its July meeting provides adequate conditions to ensure the convergence of inflation to the targets path.The September Copom Minutes will be released next Thursday, September 9.
