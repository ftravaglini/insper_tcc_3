[{"Titulo": "146th Meeting", "Conteudo": "  \t \tBras\u00edlia - In light of inflation prospects for the targets path, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 8.75 percent, without bias. Considering, on the one hand, the monetary policy easing implemented since January, and on the other hand, the idle margin of production factors, among other factors, the Committee evaluates that this basic interest rate level is consistent with a benign inflationary scenario, contributing to ensure the maintenance of inflation in line with the targets path during the relevant forecast period, as well as to the non-inflationary recovery of economic activity. The October Copom Minutes will be released in Portuguese next Thursday, October 29.
